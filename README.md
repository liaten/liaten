Creating a Cydia Repository using Github Pages
In this tutorial I will be showing you how to create a Github Pages. My goal for this tutorial is for you to create a Cydia Repository and me explaining how to setup this repo as simply as possible.

Part 0: What is a Cydia repository used for?
A Cydia repository can be used for many things, from creating tweak and themes to hosting tweaks and themes. I have created this tutorial and trusted you all to not use this for creating piracy repos.

Preparations
There are a few things you will need to have before setting up a repo:
1) A Github account with a verified email and is not flagged or not permitted to use Github Pages
2) Git or the Github Desktop app
3) Archiving program that supports archiving bzip2 like 7-Zip
4) A jailbroken device in which you can test your repo (Optional but recommended)
5) Notepad++ or simillar (Optional but recommended)
